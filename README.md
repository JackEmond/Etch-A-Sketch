# Etch-A-Sketch

This is a Etch-A-Sketch project I created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. When the user drags their mouse across the grid it will draw a line. The user also has the option to change the grid size from 1x1 all the way up to an 80x80 grid. They can also choose the colour of the line. Their options included changing the line colour to blue, red, black, or picking a colour from the colour picker. They can also choose the random colour option which will have a random colour for each square on the grid. Finally their is a reset button to clear their exisiting information.
